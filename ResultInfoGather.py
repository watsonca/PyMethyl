##Program to put results into file that can be easily seen.

##Packages needed for this program

        ##Global variable directory names. These are embedded into the code and were
        ##made for beginers to be able to place their own directories in place and
        ##program should run.

        ##methylated regions and if the regions was methylated at all or not.
